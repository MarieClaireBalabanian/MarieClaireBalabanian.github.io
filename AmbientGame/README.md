AMBIEN*t



About:

AMBIEN*t is a game for insomniacs, a stripped down, vibey version of Breakout. It's for those who lie in bed, in the dark, at 4am, dying to sleep, bored as hell, and wanting something that's not too stimulating or cerebral. Something ambient and soothing. The goal is to keep the ball moving by tracking it with the paddle. But truly, the goal is to zone out and fall asleep after prolonged exposure to the somewhat trippy visuals, moody looped music, and eye fatigue. Wishful thinking, perhaps.




User Stories: (i lost my wireframe)

-load website
-the player is alerted of the instruction and presses OK to confirm they've been read.
-once the ball launches, the goal is to move the paddle around and have the ball bounce off of it instead of hitting the x-axis. The game goes on and on and on until the paddle doesn't catch the ball in time and the ball hits the bottom of the game frame. 
-once loser loses, an alert alerts them of their loss and they press ok to close out the alert. Then the whole game reloads. 



Technologies:

I used HTML Canvas, CSS, Javascript, and one lonely JQuery tidbit.




Problems:

I had so many problems.... you know about most of em!!!!! I could write a novel. Though, i will say I had a problem with the end game alert. Sometimes, when the ball hits the x-axis, the alert will pop up twice before allowing the page to reload. 




Things you would like to do:

-have multiple rounds, where ball x,y change is increased by 1px per round.
-new background image with each new round.
-new song with each new round.
-NO ALERTS. It was out of desperation that I used them. Upon page load, a stylish text box will fade in in the middle of the screen with the instructions and have a little "x" button to close it out. Use same style text box when player loses to alert them of their sad, sad loss.
-have initial ball state be at rest and connect ball movement to spacebar. So user has start/stop control.
-Have a cancel option for the end of game alert box, so the page doesn't reload and just stays as is. Cause the music and all of that stuff restarting can be annoying if you're really really bad at this game. And then have a seperate reload button.
